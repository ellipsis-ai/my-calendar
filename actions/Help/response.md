I can show you what's happening on your calendar today, and send reminders when events are about to begin. (This skill requires access to your Google Calendar.)

**Actions:**
- `@{ellipsis.teamInfo.botName} what's on my calendar today` — show your agenda (list all events) for the rest of the day
- `@{ellipsis.teamInfo.botName} what's on my calendar now` — show any events happening now or in the next 10 minutes
- `@{ellipsis.teamInfo.botName} setup my calendar` — set up the skill to send you your agenda each weekday, and send you reminders a few minutes before events begin
- `@{ellipsis.teamInfo.botName} stop my calendar` — turn off the scheduled agenda and reminders
